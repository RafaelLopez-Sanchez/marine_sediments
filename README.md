This page contains several folders with .csv files and scripts for this articles.


- Beta Diversity': CSV of the Beta diversity matrix at the class level.

'CAZymes in sediments': CSV matrixes of CAZyme counts and extracellular  CAZyme counts found in our metagenome samples.

'LEfSe': CSV matrixes of LEfSe traits (oxic/anoxic) for taxonomic matrixes at the class level and CAZymes of our metagenome samples.

'MAGs': CSV matrixes of Extracellular CAZymes found in our MAGs, and CAZyme counts in sediment MAGs vs Soil MAGs. CSV tables of MAG taxonomy of CAZyme Gene Clusters (CGCs) found in our MAGs.

'Marker Genes': CSV matrix of Marker Gene counts found in our metagenome samples.

'Metadata': CSV from metadata from the NCBI's and local project of the marine sediments used in this article.

'Nayfach MAGs': CSV of the MAGs from the Nayfach project used in this article.

'Oxic/anoxic': CSV of the normalized counts of HCOs and NORs found in our metagenome samples.

'Taxonomy sediments': CSVs of the taxonomic classes of bacteria and phylums of archaea found abundant in our metagenomes (more than 1% abundance).
